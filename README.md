## Break The Great Firewall
In China mainland,you can't access to some websites like Google,Facebook,Twitter and so on.
The Chinese Government sets The Great Firewall between the users and the Internet.
The wall doesn't allow data from special websites to transfer data to users in order to 'delete' things not good for the government.

BUT,IT'S GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY-PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.
SOME COUNTRIES DON'T WANT US TO BE STRONG.
THEY WANT TO USE THE NETWORK TO CHANGE OUR MIND.
WE SHOULD LOVE OUR COUNTRY!

If you want to use Google to search,Facebook to make friends,Twitter to watch Donald Trump,etc.
Just download the extension (Link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Y-2yk0gJjnyPq469yEBIDw Passcode:wtqk)

## Release Download Speed Limit of Baidu Skydrive
There are lots of good things in Baidu Skydrive,as I mentioned. But Baidu limits you speed of downloading files. Imagine you are downloading a 2.47GB file with the speed of 10KB/s,it's terrible!(Baidu provides 2TB space for each user,so they limit the speed,or they'll collapse.) As the saying goes,'Master in civil',yi ming(username) writes a script to release download speed limit. Before you download this script,you need to download the extension:Tampermonkey
### The Powerful Extension:Tampermonkey
*Tampermonkey is the most popular userscript manager, with over 10 million users. It's available for Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera Next, and Firefox.* 

*Tampermonkey makes it very easy to manage your userscripts and provides features like a clear overview over the running scripts, a built-in editor, ZIP-based import and export, automatic update checks and browser and cloud storage based synchronization.*
(According to [Offical]),download from [Here].

### The Powerful Website:GreasyFork
Introduction:
*GreasyFork is a site for user scripts.*

*What are user scripts?*

*User scripts put you in control of your browsing experience. Once installed, they automatically make the sites you visit better by adding features, making them easier to use, or taking out the annoying bits. The user scripts on Greasy Fork were written by other users and posted to share with the world. They're free to install and easy to use.* Official site: https://greasyfork.org. [Download the script] 

[Download the Script]:https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/39776-%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E7%BD%91%E7%9B%98%E7%9B%B4%E6%8E%A5%E4%B8%8B%E8%BD%BD%E5%8A%A9%E6%89%8B%E4%BF%AE%E6%94%B9%E7%89%88

[**ATTENTION**:You'd better not use it when you're signed in. Baidu is always checking if users are using scripts. Do it in a private mode(Sharing Files is a good function)]
