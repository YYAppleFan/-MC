# OS

OS，operating system,is a computer program that organizes a number of other programs at the same time.
In this part,I'll introduce Windows® and macOS®。

# Windows
Windows'UI(User Interface) design is from Apple.
Apple's UI design was from Xerox.
macOS was the first OS with UI.
Bill Gates saw that and founded Microsoft and developed Windows 1.0.

After that,Apple was angry because Windows is more famous than its Mac OS.
You may wonder the reason.
Because Microsoft agreed to let IBM to use their OS, but Apple.
Then Apple took Microsoft to court and ... lost it.

>Windows 1.0

Years later, Micosoft created the most famous OS,Windows XP(XP means experience,also,vista means beautiful views).
It was released in 2001.
It brought a brand new UI,a nicer startup music,IE 6 and lots of new features.
Chinese government,many enterprises and families used it.
Until 2017,25% Chinese users are still using Windows XP.
The OS has influenced other OS for ten years.
>![](https://gss2.bdstatic.com/-fo3dSag_xI4khGkpoWK1HF6hhy/baike/crop%3D0%2C45%2C1024%2C676%3Bc0%3Dbaike116%2C5%2C5%2C116%2C38/sign=876cbbe4ba51f819e56a590ae78466d9/9345d688d43f87941abc75e1d81b0ef41ad53ab9.jpg)

>Windows XP

8 years passed, Microsoft released Windows 7, the most useful and beautiful Windows ever.
It brought Aero again,a brand new UI,a better support for 64-bit.
Now,over 70% PC(Personal Computer) users are using Windows 7,21% use Windows 10,8% use Windows XP.
Others are using Windows 8,macOS,Linux&other OS.
>![](https://gss0.bdstatic.com/-4o3dSag_xI4khGkpoWK1HF6hhy/baike/crop%3D59%2C0%2C681%2C449%3Bc0%3Dbaike92%2C5%2C5%2C92%2C30/sign=41f77a2ff9deb48fef26fb9ecd2a0305/e1fe9925bc315c6088a58ba187b1cb1349547748.jpg)

>Windows 7

Windows 7 is stable.
Most softwares are based on Windows 7.
Gamers prefers to play games on it.
Most enterprises are using it to do important things.
There are no many viruses,stupid errors.
You can concentrate on everything you're doing.
I love it.
>![](https://gss1.bdstatic.com/-vo3dSag_xI4khGkpoWK1HF6hhy/baike/c0%3Dbaike272%2C5%2C5%2C272%2C90/sign=1cc831e464061d95694b3f6a1a9d61b4/4e4a20a4462309f7259be5ce780e0cf3d6cad672.jpg)

>Windows 10

Microsoft,the largest OS company,is under pressure.
Apple and Google announced that their iOS and Android (two largest OS in mobile) would be free.
Thus in 2015,Microsoft released Windows 10 and it's free to Windows 7,8,8.1 users for an year.
It's like Windows 7+Windows 8.
It brought cross-platform applications,new Aero UI,notification center(on the right side),game mode and many new feature coming.
It has a new update option:Always on.
You can't disable it.
It caused trouble.
For example,a host is announcing the weather forecast with a Windows 10 PC.
When she turned around,she saw 'Windows is updating,please wait... 1% completed'.
She was surprised,'Windows wants to kill the bad weather too!'233.
However,it protects the computers from Wannacry's attack.
PC running Windows 7,8,8.1 with auto update off were attacked,even the government were attacked too.
Windows 10 is still improving itself and not very stable for old computers which aren't pre-installed Windows 10.
In the next part,I'll talk about device driver.

## Device Driver
If you need print something,you'll install a printer then your file will be printed.
How does the printer communicate with the computer?
It's the **Device Driver**.
>![](http://chuantu.biz/t6/310/1526135269x-1404758395.png)
>Devices and printers on Windows 7

Device driver is a program connects the device with the computer.
The screen,mouse,keyboard and even USB need it.
Thus,if the devices don't work properly,you should update or reinstall its device driver.
Usually,it can be found on the official sites.
However,it's too slow.
You can install a program that help you check and install device drivers correctly like [Driver Genius].
If you can't start Minecraft and there's no Minecraft windows,your screen's driver will probably go wrong.
You need update it.

## Network
Your computer is prepared already.
Time to surf!
Before you're going,you should have a COMPLETE network.
>![](https://gss3.bdstatic.com/7Po3dSag_xI4khGkpoWK1HF6hhy/baike/c0%3Dbaike92%2C5%2C5%2C92%2C30/sign=fe766d7488025aafc73f76999a84c001/359b033b5bb5c9ea3aab2857df39b6003af3b32d.jpg)

>Some banned websites

### Break The Great Firewall
In China mainland,you can't access to some websites like Google,Facebook,Twitter and so on.
The Chinese Government sets The Great Firewall between the users and the Internet.
The wall doesn't allow special websites to transfer data to users in order to 'delete' things that are not good for the government.

BUT,IT'S GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY-PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.
>![](https://gss1.bdstatic.com/-vo3dSag_xI4khGkpoWK1HF6hhy/baike/crop%3D0%2C3%2C1280%2C847%3Bc0%3Dbaike150%2C5%2C5%2C150%2C50/sign=1cc23eabcfcec3fd9f71fd35ebb8f80c/9358d109b3de9c8274883ae86081800a18d843ec.jpg)

SOME COUNTRIES DON'T WANT US TO BE STRONG.
THEY WANT TO USE THE NETWORK TO CHANGE OUR MIND.
WE SHOULD LOVE OUR COUNTRY!

If you want to use Google to search,Facebook to make friends,Twitter to watch Donald Trump,etc.
Shadowsocks will help you.
[Shadowsocks](shadowsocks.org) is an application where you can use high quality proxy.

This kind of proxy is far more secure than VPN,it uses SOCK5 Technology which can't be encrypt at all. It also supports over 15 encrytion methods like aes-256-cfb,chacha20,rc4-md5,etc.,you can even add Obfs and Protocol to your connection.

Because GFW is much stricter than before, free services all always unstable.
So it's the time to pay. I don't want to pay too, but I have got some cheap services.
* Add my QQ(2428405831) and pay 30RMB for high-speed and unlimited SSR.
* Go to [Wait For wind,and YOU](http://www.waitwind.ga/auth/register?code=GBkk7S6AtZbFzD48935TQW6S13YpT5Wg) to buy a monthly service, from 5RMB for 50GB.
So how to use? Click [here](http://www.waitwind.ga/user/announcement) to learn. 

### Beautify Chrome
After breaking,you can surf with Chrome.
I advise you to use Google Chrome because it's fast and secure.
You may wonder the reason.
Because every browser you know uses its kernel,like 360,Quark,Sogou,QQ...
Chrome updates fast.
New features are quickly added and it's STABLE.
[Let's learn some advanced skills of it.](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?hl=zh-Hans&ref_topic=14678)
>![](https://gss2.bdstatic.com/-fo3dSag_xI4khGkpoWK1HF6hhy/baike/c0%3Dbaike80%2C5%2C5%2C80%2C26/sign=7c0485e09b8fa0ec6bca6c5f47fe328b/2cf5e0fe9925bc3142b4464b54df8db1ca137073.jpg)

>Google Chrome Icon

Chrome is strong.
we can use it to make a better experience with [*Stylus*],an extension in Chrome Web Store.
Try some of them below!

### Download
You need download things from the Internet.
The download function in Chrome is very slow.
To fix that,I'll introduce two tools to you.
#### IDM 
Internet Download Manager (IDM) is the most popular downloading tools in the world.
It can download files very fast.
It separates one file into many parts and downloads every part with original speed.
It supports video downloading (catch from the websites),FTP downloading and downloading tasks from browsers.
It's a pity that it doesn't support BT,magnet and ed2k.
The next tool will fix it.

([Download](http://internetdownloadmanager.com),[patch](http://idman.ys168.com/))
![](http://chuantu.biz/t6/310/1526210832x-1404795666.png)
#### FDM
Free Download Manager (FDM) is free and has amodern design.
It can download BT and magnet.
However,it costs more RAM than IDM.

([Download](http://www.freedownloadmanager.org))
![](http://chuantu.biz/t6/310/1526211129x-1404795666.png)
### Upload
You may download too many things from the Internet and your disk is almost full.
The best way is to buy a 1TB disk,but it costs a lot.
I'll talk about another way,cloud services.
#### Baidu Skydrive
![](https://gss1.bdstatic.com/9vo3dSag_xI4khGkpoWK1HF6hhy/baike/c0%3Dbaike80%2C5%2C5%2C80%2C26/sign=65d35d63c1ef7609280691cd4fb4c8a9/5366d0160924ab18fe0cb8c93ffae6cd7b890b31.jpg)

Baidu is one of a few companies which still offer cloud services.
When you create an account with your phone numver,Baidu'll give you 2TB space.
That's a big number.
Also,many files are uploaded to it,such as movies,pictures and documents.The only bad thing is... 
## Release Download Speed Limit of Baidu Skydrive
There are lots of good things in Baidu Skydrive,as I mentioned. But Baidu limits you speed of downloading files. Imagine you are downloading a 2.47GB file with the speed of 10KB/s,it's terrible!(Baidu provides 2TB space for each user,so they limit the speed,or they'll collapse.) As the saying goes,'Master in civil',yi ming(username) writes a script to release download speed limit. Before you download this script,you need to download the extension:Tampermonkey
### Proxyee-Down
[Proxyee-Down](https://github.com/proxyee-down-org/proxyee-down) is a project which help download files faster on GitHub.
It uses [Man-in-the-middle attack](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/中间人攻击) to get the webpage, then the proxy server will edit the page in order to release the limit. Here is the way to use it.
* [Download the program](https://imhx-my.sharepoint.com/personal/pd_imhx_onmicrosoft_com/Documents/Forms/All.aspx?slrid=8f94999e-10b7-0000-3f2c-5ca9b5ceecd6&RootFolder=%2Fpersonal%2Fpd_imhx_onmicrosoft_com%2FDocuments%2Fproxyee-down&FolderCTID=0x012000536DC31294EC264084FE880734F95AEA), remember to choose the latest version.
* Extract the package, then click on [Proxyee Down.exe]()
* Install the extension for Baidu Skydrive [Tutorial]（https://github.com/proxyee-down-org/proxyee-down/wiki/%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85%E6%89%A9%E5%B1%95）

[**ATTENTION**:You'd better not use it when you're signed in. Baidu is always checking if users are using scripts. Do it in a private mode(Sharing Files is a good function)]

### Tencent Weiyun
Every QQ user can get 10GB space for free.
If you're using TIM, you'll find out that you can get another 1TB space by inviting others to log in to TIM.
Compared with Baidu,there are both upload and download speed limit,also,fewer resources.

### Others
* Microsoft Onedrive is another choice. Only 15GB Is free to unpaid users.
* Apple iCloud has 5GB space for everybody who has an Apple ID.
* Google has an UNLIMITED storage for videos and photos,15GB for documents.

## Useful Softwares
* Unlocker:Delete everything. No warnings.
* Dock:Apple Mac's dock on Windows.
* Office:Nothing more to say.
* PhotoShop,Animation,Premire from Adobe.
* [Download all of them](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1F-ghg9V3c1xBsIMrzSjChA)

## Security and Performance
Every PC user hopes that the computer can runvery fast and safely.
Here are some tips.

- 1.No anti-virus programs. 
Most of they do nothing.
They just keep telling you to install other products from the company and slow down your computer.
If you really need one,[Avira](https://www.avira.com) is the best.

- 2.Turn on auto updates and Windows Defender.
Nobody knows better about Windows than Microsoft.
Microsoft will help you all the time.
- 3.Don't make some programs start with the system.
 >(1) Press  ![](https://msegceporticoprodassets.blob.core.windows.net/asset-blobs/11847_zh-cn_2) +R and type 'msconfig'.

>(2) Choose the fourth tab,then disable the programs.

- 4.Close the background programs.
>(1) Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc

>(2) Right-click on the program,click 'End Process'.

- 5.Always clean the disk.
>(1) Press  ![](https://msegceporticoprodassets.blob.core.windows.net/asset-blobs/11847_zh-cn_2),click 'The PC'.

>(2)Right-click the disk you want to clean and click 'Properties'.

>(3) Click 'Cleanup'

>(4) Choose the things you want to delete,and click 'OK'.

# Mobile OS
*Think Different*——Steve Jobs

Since I'm only using iDevices,I will only talk about iOS.
Any Android user wants to make a contibution,go to pull requests.
[Tips](https://tips.apple.com/zh-cn/ios) are the offcial source by Apple.
It also offers an app on iDevices.
[Help](https://help.apple.com) is the offcial guide by Apple.

## Performance
iDevices are powerful with iOS.
Unfortunately, iOS 11 behaves like rubbish.
The best way is upgrading to iOS 12 Beta.

### Join Apple Beta Software Program
Common users can install public betas.
1.Go to [ABSP](https://beta.apple.com)

2.Join the program with your Apple ID.

3.Download and install the profile.
If passcode is needed,enter that.

4.Tap 'Restart'

5.Go to **Settings -> General -> Software Update** to install the beta software.

### Install Developer Beta
Developer betas are released quicker than public betas,more features are added but more unstable.

1.Go to [iBeta](https://ibeta.me)

2.Tap 'iOS 12 beta'

3.Install the profile.
If passcode is needed,enter that.

4.Tap 'Restart'

5.Go to **Settings -> General -> Software Update** to install the beta software.

[**ATTENTION**:Bugs are always seen in beta software,you can report them by 'Feedback' App]

## App
